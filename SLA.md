# Service Level Agreement

_**Effective: March 1, 2022**_

Aureum provides a 99.9% [Uptime commitment](#uptime-commitment) for customers on the Enterprise Plan and above (our **Service Level Agreement** or **SLA**). If we fall short of our 99.9% Uptime commitment and your workspace is affected, we’ll apply a [Service Credit](#service-credits) to your account for future use.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Downtime

---

**Downtime** is the overall number of minutes Aureum was unavailable during a Aureum calendar quarter (i.e., Jan 1 through March 31 and every three month period thereafter). Aureum calculates unavailability using server monitoring software to measure the server side error rate, ping test results, web server tests, TCP port tests, and website tests.

Downtime excludes the following:

- Slowness or other performance issues with individual features (link expansions, search, file uploads, etc.)
- Issues that are related to external apps or third parties, including Aureum Connect
- Any products or features identified as pilot, alpha, beta or similar
- External network or equipment problems outside of our reasonable control, such as bad routing tables between your internet service provider (ISP) and our server
- [Scheduled Downtime](#scheduled-downtime) for maintenance

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Uptime Commitment

---

**Uptime** is the percentage of total possible minutes Aureum was available during a fiscal quarter. Our commitment is to maintain at least 99.9% Uptime:

**_\[(total minutes in quarter - Downtime) / total minutes in quarter\] > 99.9%_**

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Scheduled Downtime

---

Sometimes we need to perform maintenance to keep Aureum working smoothly. If scheduled downtime is necessary, we’ll give you at least 48 hours advance notice. In a year, scheduled downtime won’t exceed 30 hours.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Service Credits

---

If we fall short of our Uptime commitment, we’ll apply a credit to each affected account equal to 10 times the amount that the workspace (or, as applicable, org) paid during the period Aureum was down (we call these **Service Credits**).

Service Credits are not refunds, cannot be exchanged into a cash amount, are capped at a maximum of 30 days of paid service, require you to have paid any outstanding invoices and expire upon termination of your customer contract. Service Credits are the sole and exclusive remedy for any failure by Aureum to meet its obligations under this SLA.

Note, Downtime doesn’t affect everyone at the same time or in the same way. For example, some accounts may receive Service Credits during an outage in their region, while other accounts in other regions that have not been similarly affected will not.
