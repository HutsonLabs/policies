Learn about how and when we offer refunds for Aureum.
A fair refund policy

With Aureum, we sell subscriptions on a monthly basis or on an annual basis. If you pay for a year of Aureum and then cancel before the year is up, we make sure you aren’t charged in the future. Your account will be accessible until your paid period ends. After that, your account will become inaccessible. You can also choose to delete your account completely, which would also stop any outbound forwarding. For more details, please read our Cancellation policy.

Here are examples of refunds for Aureum for You we’d grant:

If you were really not happy with Aureum, you can have your money back.
We’ll also consider giving credits for future cycles if something goes wrong on our side. For example, if we had extended downtime (multiple hours in a day, or multiple days in a month) or you emailed customer service and it took multiple days to get back to you, we’ll issue a partial credit to your account.

At the end of the day, nearly everything on the edges comes down to a case-by-case basis. [Send us a note]({{support@hutsonlabs.freshdesk.com}}), tell us what’s up, and we’ll work with you to make sure you’re happy.
